# Lab 02: Maximum

## Objectives
- Read data from the keyboard.
- Compose boolean expressions using comparison operators.
- Implement conditional logic (if, else, and elif).

## Program Description
This program will prompt the user to enter three integer numbers and determine the maximum of these three numbers.

## Program Specifications
1. Create a new class called `Maximum`.
2. Use a `Scanner` object to read input from the keyboard.
3. Declare four integer variables named:
   - `number1`
   - `number2`
   - `number3`
   - `max`
4. Prompt the user to enter values for variables `number1`, `number2`, and `number3`.
5. Find the maximum of `number1`, `number2`, and `number3`, then assign it to the `max` variable.
6. Display the maximum value.

## Sample Output
```
This program finds the maximum of three integer numbers.
Enter the 1st integer: 1
Enter the 2nd integer: -1
Enter the 3rd integer: 0
The maximum is 1
```

## Coding Standards
- Follow the program specifications exactly.
- Use meaningful identifiers and follow Java naming conventions.
- Remove all auto-generated comments and unused code.
- Document code using [JavaDoc](https://www.baeldung.com/javadoc), including:
   - Program/class description
   - Attribution using the `@author` tag.
- Comment only when necessary.
- Format code cleanly and consistently
   - Proper indentation
   - Brace alignment
   - Whitespace for readability
- Ensure prompts and output are clear and properly formatted.
