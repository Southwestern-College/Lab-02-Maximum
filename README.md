# Project: Maximum

## Objectives
1. Read data from the keyboard.
2. Compose boolean expressions using comparison operators.
3. Implement conditional logic (if, else, and elif).

## Program Description
This program will prompt the user to enter three integer numbers and determine the maximum of these three numbers.


## Program Specifications
1. Create a new class called `Maximum`.
2. Use a `Scanner` object to read input from the keyboard.
3. Declare four integer variables named:
   - `x`
   - `y`
   - `z`
   - `max`
4. Prompt the user to enter values for variables `x`, `y`, and `z`.
5. Find the maximum of `x`, `y`, and `z`, then assign it to the `max` variable.
6. Display the maximum value.

## Sample Output
```
This program finds the maximum of three integer numbers.
Enter the 1st integer: 1
Enter the 2nd integer: -1
Enter the 3rd integer: 0
The maximum is 1
```

## Coding Standards
1. Use meaningful variable names (e.g., `num1`, `num2`, `num3` instead of `x`, `y`, `z`).
2. Remove any comments generated by your IDE.
3. Include a comment that contains your name and the date of your last revision.
4. Write descriptive comments to explain the code.
5. Ensure user-friendly output messages.
6. Organize the code in a way that is easy to read.
